# Neural Loops

**⚠ USE IT WITH CAUTION. The app is pure client side rendering. The downloading and inference take ~30 seconds to finish.**

✨ Create sounds, notes, and music with machine learning algorithms interactively.

Neural Loops is a co-creation tool which allows users to explore and manipulate musical loops synthesized by neural network generative models. In search of the perfect loop, users can independently manipulate both the musical score (notes and rhythms) and the waveforms used to perform the score as audio. Neural Loops is a step towards music creation software which does not assume expertise on the part of the user, but still allows the user to customize the produced music to taste.
